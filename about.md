## About Me

How's it goin', eh? (jk, im not canadian (though Wisconsin is not that far from Canada))

My name is Mark! (and the exclamation mark is important), and I'm just some (sarcastic) guy on the internet that makes music, does stuff in linux (wow, ain't I a nerd?), and occasionally writes things (posts, articles, code, etc). Navigating this website should help you find everything you may be looking for.

## About This Website

This website is my personal little project that serves in part as my personal little portfolio (omg; redundant wording!), and in part as my own venue to talk about literally anything I feel like. This website is generated with Jekyll and written in Markdown. I host this website in [one of my github repos](https://github.com/MarkSilverMedia/msm-site), which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (so feel free to fork my source code).
