Houston, we have another site overhaul!

Not that I can assume anyone saw the previous one, but whatever. This time around, it's friggin' weird coz I'm writing in Markdown (which I'm totally unexperienced with) and letting Jekyll automatically handle my theming + feed; things that I'd prefer to do manually, but this makes life so much easier. ;P

Hopefully, this will incentivise me to be active on my own platform, but we'll see where this goes.
