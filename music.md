## Solo Work

I've been releasing music that I write/record/produce/ &amp; whatnot since October of 2012, and to this day, my solo work remains my primary focus. It'd be really hard for me to categorize it under any particular genre on account of the fact that I'm quite often trying something new. What follows is a selection of links to different bandcamp pages where I've released my solo work:

[Current/Main Discography](https://marksilver.bandcamp.com/)
[Live Performances](https://marklive.bandcamp.com/)
[Extra/Bonus Content and Alternative Pseudonyms](https://silveralt.bandcamp.com/)
[Older/Legacy/Archive Discography](https://silvermediaproductions.bandcamp.com/)

Be on the look out for my eponymous album, which will be released on the 22nd of August 2017. ;)

## Collaborative Work

### EMAWM

["EMAWM"](http://emawm.tk) (Extremely Musical Artists Will Musicalize) is a public demo archive where I, along with my good friends [Chris](https://christophertom.bandcamp.com/) and [Josh](https://spiffyflinger.bandcamp.com/), post work-in-progress music. The EMAWM Project also kinda doubles as [somewhat of a record label](http://emawm.tk/releases) that categorizes plugs to projects both within and independent of EMAWM. Stay tuned for a possible EP from us sometime in the future. ;)

### Nerd Central / EMAWM Live

I've always described "Nerd Central" as the result of performing slick music in a skype call w/ your internet friends. The term was coined for this use in 2014 before I joined I had any involvement in it, and carried over into the sessions I recorded back when I used to be a member of the Scratchbupers group. All recordings using with "Nerd Central" in the title can be found [here](http://nerdcentral.emawm.tk/). Myself and my friends at the EMAWM project recorded a session on the first of April that will be coming out soon, but under the name "EMAWM Live", because I didn't invite any non-EMAWM Scratchbupers to participate in that session, &amp; I'd feel kinda shitty about attributing "Nerd Central" to any such instance.
